How the genetic parameters were chosen and how code was tested:
	What fraction of each population did was fit enough to mate?
	
	For every generation, programs that were above the average of the average fitness and the max fitness would go through to the next generation. 
	I.E., any program with a fitness > (avg + max)/2

	How did you arrange the mating and mutations?

	For mating: the ones that automatically went to the next generation (those > avg. of avg. fitness and max fitness - (avg+max)/2) mated with random programs until our next generation has 200 programs. This is done by the function crossover() from the class Program.

	Mutations: After adding all the programs that have a fitness of greater than the average of average fitness and max fitness, the algorithm starts adding crossovers between the automatically-passed-through programs (goodprogs) and random programs from all of the programs from last generation.
	This is the first source of mutations. Then, every 15 programs added to the next generation will be mutated. This is done by the function mutate(),
	also from the class Program.
